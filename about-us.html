        <p class="ex1">Ibn Sina is a website to help people in need, and they do not have the financial ability to buy some of the drugs on the market at a very high price, and these drugs are in dire need of them. The idea came from the current situation in world and
            because of the covid-19 disease that swept world and led to the rejection of a large number of young people at the head of their work in the company because of the economic crisis that occurred in world and this idea we have seen in many Arab
            countries It is not present in our country Jordan. We are a group of young people who have made a decision in order to help this category of people through the creation of this website.</p>
